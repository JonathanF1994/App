# App
This is a Project for a party app. For more details contact me or view the *"README.md"*

## What is this for a project?
One day, a friend came to me and say: "Hey Jonathan, whats di you think what goes tonight in Leipzig?"
So, i looked a littlebit in facebook and find something where we can go. But for people, they didnt know the city, it would be hard to find a good location. After one or twoe beers, we had the idea! A App, where you can find every party in a radius of a variable distance. There would be a live chat, how the party goes and a live reccomend feature for partys. The Partys you're gonna see, are sorted by relavanz and rating. 

## Search for developers 
I'm looking for some developers. All of this, what you gonna do is for free. I dont pay you. 
If you're interrested, wrote me an E-Mail.
